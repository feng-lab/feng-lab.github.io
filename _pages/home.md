# Welcome to the Feng Lab
We develop novel image processing, computer vision, data mining and visualization algorithms to efficiently extract useful knowledge out of large-scale, heterogeneous bioimage data. We focus on developing bioimage informatics platform (e.g. [neuTube {% icon fa-external-link %}](http://neutracing.com)) for reconstructing and analyzing multiscale brain connectivity.

**We are looking for passionate new Postdocs, Graduate students, and Interns to join the team!** If you are interested in working with us, please send me an [email](mailto:feng@kist.re.kr). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV.
